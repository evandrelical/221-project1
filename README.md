============
This is a team project to implement a simple (250 - 300 lines, excluding data structures) console-based C game program, and to translate this game to assembly language.

Calls to C library functions should be limited to printf and scanf functions.  Other calls are possible but the work to call library functions from assembly language is difficult.

The game that Team 1 has chosen to implement is 2-player Hangman. Player 1 will provide the word, and Player 2 will guess the word. Player 2 has 10 tries before the stick figure is hung and the game is over.

The original source code for this revised game is from:
